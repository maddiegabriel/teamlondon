Welcome to... CRIME CRUISER!

This is our final project for CIS*2250 Team London xD.
Find all our code versions here as well as our documentation.

The current version is named crime_criuser.pl
It is designed to use the crime_data.csv file from the stats Canada website. The file can be downloaded here (it's about 3 million lines long so beware):

http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a26?lang=eng&id=2520051&p2=33#downloadTab

To run, simply download the Perl script and the CSV file into the same folder on your computer. Rename the CSV file to crime_data.csv. Run the program from your terminal by typing:

  >> perl crime_cruiser.pl
  
 and go wild! Graph PDFS are created in the same folder where the Perl script is. 

ENJOY!
